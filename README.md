# Sales Prediction Using Python

## Overview
Sales prediction involves forecasting the future sales of a product or service by analyzing historical data and considering various influencing factors. This project aims to utilize machine learning techniques in Python to predict future sales, enabling businesses to make informed decisions regarding advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and platform selection. By leveraging these predictions, businesses can optimize their advertising strategies and maximize sales potential.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information on sales along with various factors that could influence sales, such as:
- **Advertising Expenditure**: Amount spent on advertising across different platforms (TV, radio, newspaper, etc.).
- **Target Audience Segmentation**: Demographics and other relevant details about the target audience.
- **Advertising Platform Selection**: Platforms used for advertising the product.

### Key Features:
- `TV`: Advertising budget spent on TV.
- `Radio`: Advertising budget spent on radio.
- `Newspaper`: Advertising budget spent on newspapers.
- `Sales`: Sales of the product (target variable).




## Key Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing:
- Handling missing values.
- Converting categorical variables to numerical format.
- Normalizing and scaling features.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Analyzing the distribution of different features.
- Identifying correlations between features and sales.
- Visualizing data using plots.

### 3. Feature Engineering:
- Creating new features from existing ones (e.g., interaction terms).
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Selecting relevant features.

### 4. Model Building:
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- Training various machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.).
- Evaluating model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
- Fine-tuning models using hyperparameter optimization.

### 5. Model Evaluation:
- Comparing different models.
- Selecting the best model based on performance metrics.
- Making predictions on the test dataset.


## Results
The final model's performance will be evaluated based on its ability to accurately predict sales. Detailed results and visualizations can be found in the notebooks.
